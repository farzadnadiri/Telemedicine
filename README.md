The implementation of this system has been done in two completely different projects, FrontEnd and Backend separately. The server-side implements a service using [NodeJs](https://github.com/nodejs/node) and [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) that communicates with RestApi, and the user side implements a single-page application using [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) for Frontend, which connects to the backend service using the API.
For real-time communication capabilities, [Socket.IO](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io) and [PeerJs](https://github.com/peers/peerjs) technologies were used, as well as [AdminLTE](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE) for the front-end template.

In terms of server architecture, it is a kind of service-oriented SOA architecture in which a request first reaches the controller API, then it must cross multiple middlewares to reach the desired action. Evaluation occurs first, followed by action, where the service is used to receive or transfer data according to its request. According to the designed model standard, the data is transformed into database schemas and stored in them, and the process is also reversed to receive data from the server. <br/><br/>
